# 2D Pose Graph Optimization

## Introduction

This is a C++ implementation of an efficient 2D pose graph optimization, by exploiting the sparsity in the graph structure, as outlined in [1, 2]

## Installation

### Dependencies

Eigen, for optimization.
OpenCV, for visualization.
```
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
```

### Source Code

The source code is hosted on GitHub: [ShahramKhorshidi/pose_graph_optimization](https://github.com/ShahramKhorshidi/pose_graph_optimization)
